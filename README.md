[See live demo](https://assessment-data-amsterdam.statichost.page)

## Features

- Shows a list of districts on the homepage.
- Shows details of a district on /stadsdeel/:identifier.
- Shows details of a quarter on /wijk/:identifier.
- Data is fetched from https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/v1/gebieden.
- Data is stored in a context, so it doesn't have to be refetched when remounting a component.
- A basic router enables navigation without triggering a full page reload, so the data in the context stays available (except when clicking the logo in the navbar, I couldn't override that behaviour).
- Uses no external dependencies, except for the packages of @amsterdam, linters, tests.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
